# adventofcode

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels.
I'll start with the 2022 in javascript and maybe for the other ones I'll use them as an exploit to learn some new program language.
I'll not compete for the leaderboard, only to improve my skills here on github and trick for javascript.
