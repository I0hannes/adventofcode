# adventofcode

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels.
I'll start with the 2022 in javascript and maybe for the other ones I'll use them as an exploit to learn some new program languages.
I'll not compete for the leaderboard, only to improve my skills and try out new techniques here on github and javascript.

I've started with the fifth day beacause I've setup vscode since that day. When I have time I'll upload the older solutions.
